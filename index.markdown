## Welcome!!!

Every month people from the studiolab and students produce a ridiculous amount of code, but unfortunately, most of the time this code together with all the knowledge that comes with it is lost on some computer folder.
This repository is an attempt to make the prototyping knowledge from the studiolab accessible to student and staff.

On this site you will find useful resources about how to build, prototype, connect and fix your interactive prototypes.
Enjoy browsing around!

We can all contribute to the repository by sharing code snippets and reference projects.

## How to contribute

#### 1. Publish your code
Publish your code, your tutorial, or your project documentation online somewhere. We highly encourage to use [github](https://github.com/) for this, but also other documentation hosting websites are very welcomed (e.g [instractables](https://www.instructables.com/), [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/))

_if you wonder what the heck is github and why nerds like it, you can find a good series of video tutorials [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV)_

#### 2 Request to add your resources to the repository
Create an account on github.com, and open a new "issue" on the repository of this website [here](https://github.com/id-studiolab/cookbook/issues).

Make sure that your issue contains:
  - A title
  - The category of your entry
  - A short description of what other people can take and learn from your code snippet/tutorials or project
  - A link to the repository where your project is hosted
  - 3 keywords

If you are already familiar with github you can also contribute by cloning the repo, edit it and maka a pull request.

#### 3. Wait for the resource to be published
Your resource will manually be added to the list, you will receive a notification when the contents will be published.
